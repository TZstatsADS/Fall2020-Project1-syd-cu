### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2020

+ Projec title: Economics and 
+ This project is conducted by [Siyu Duan]

+ Project summary: [a short summary] The primary interest of this project is to explore how Americans vote in the light of financial crisis in 2009.  My motivation of this topic is that since 2020 is also a presidential election year, with the similar impacts of COVID-19 made on economics, it might be some things that we can learn from 2008 and can help us understand how American vote this year.  The followings are the questions that are explored in this project:
	-  What is American voters'  personal income in 2007 by gender?
	-  What is American voters' employment status in the light of 2008 financial crisis? What do they think about  their financial situations next year?
	-  What are Americans' opinions about personal future in general?  What are they opinion about government intervention on economics?
